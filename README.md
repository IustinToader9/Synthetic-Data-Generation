Generating synthetic time-series data for Walmart's store sales, downloaded from [Kaggle's M5 Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data?select=sales_train_validation.csv). 

The synthetic data is generated using [YData Synthetic TimeGAN implementation](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic)

The purpose of this exercise is to anonymize data to be used in our collaborative forecasting framework in order to preserve the privacy of data owners while maintaining forecasting accuracy.
